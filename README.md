# Fundraiser Manager

## Introduction

For the IT4045 Final Project, our group decided to make a fundraiser manager. The fundraiser manager allows organizers to set up an online space for their fundraiser. This allows any participants the ability to see information about a fundraiser, compare how much they have sold compared to other participants, and see if / how many rewards they qualify    for from the organizers. Organizers are able to edit information about their fundraiser, establish rewards / reward tiers, and edit members and member information.

 As a user, I want to be able to see information about a fundraiser so that I can compare how much they have sold compared to other participants and see if / how many rewards they qualify for from the organizers. 
 
 Example 1 
Given: A feed of fundraiser data are available 
When: The user searches for a particular fundraiser (recognizable name)
Then: The fundraiser app will return any results and save in view list


Example 2 
Given: Fundraiser data available 
When: The user searches for “aaofdnoas” (not recognizable text)
Then: The fundraiser app will not return any results and not save in view list 


Example 3 
Given: The fundraiser app saved user’s searched fundraiser  
When: The User clicks and views the fundraiser
Then: The user will see how much they have sold compared to other participants


Example 4 
Given: The fundraiser app saved user’s searched fundraiser  
When: The User clicks and views the fundraiser
Then: The user will see how many rewards they qualify for from the organizers


Example 5 
Given: The user has previous fundraisers in the view list 
When: Some of the previous fundraisers have expired 
Then: The user can select expired fundraiser and click delete button to remove from the view list.
