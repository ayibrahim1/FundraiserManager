# Fundraiser Manager

## Introduction

For the IT4045 Final Project, our group decided to make a fundraiser manager. The fundraiser manager allows organizers to set up an online space for their fundraiser, allowing
 any participants the ability to see information about the fundraiser, compare how much they have sold compared to other participants, and see if / how many rewards they qualify    for from the organizers. Organizers are able to edit information about their fundraiser, establish rewards / reward tiers, and edit members and member information.
