# Fundraiser Manager

## Introduction

For the IT4045 Final Project, our group decided to make a fundraiser manager. The fundraiser manager allows organizers to set up an online space for their fundraiser. This allows any participants the ability to see information about a fundraiser, compare how much they have sold compared to other participants, and see if / how many rewards they qualify    for from the organizers. Organizers are able to edit information about their fundraiser, establish rewards / reward tiers, and edit members and member information.
